# The CS-Cart Boilerplate Theme
### A CS-Cart theme based on HTML5 Twitter Bootstrap 3.3.5

The Boilerplate theme exists to simplify custom design development for CS-Cart. It uses [Bootstrap 3.3.5](http://getbootstrap.com/), that provides pre-built reusable components such as dropdowns, navigation, buttons, and other interface elements. You get the building blocks and the example of how they can be put together to create a theme.

Boilerplate only has 1,000 lines of our CSS code left, as opposed to 11,000 lines in CS-Cart’s standard Responsive theme (and we aim to get rid of our CSS entirely). That way you don’t have to figure out our code: if you are familiar with Bootstrap, you can get started quickly.

We’re looking forward to your pull requests and issues with suggestions on how we can improve Boilerplate. Let’s work on it together, and eventually all of us will have to work less.
Read our [detailed blog post](http://blog.cs-cart.com/2015/12/25/cs-cart-boilerplate-theme-minimum-of-code-maximum-of-flexibility/) to learn about all the features of the new CS-Cart Boilerplate theme.
